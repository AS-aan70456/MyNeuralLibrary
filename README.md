## About

Simple library for working with simple neural networks

---

### Features

  - The library contains a perceptron neural network
  - Еhe function of a corrective neuron is implemented in the neural network
  - The skin neural network can react dynamically
---

### Tech and Lerning

This library is based on matrix algorithms, it is the most optimized and popular perceptron algorithm:

### Building
For any changes to the source, the corresponding modules must be built. As a safety (to prevent hair-ripping oversights) feature, use the 'Build all' option in Visual Studio where able.

### Future plans

  - Improved II
  - Add convolutional neural networks
  - Add fully connected neural networks
  - Add loosely coupled neural networks
  - Add neural network manager
